# Correlation Analysis: Addiction Rates vs Mobile App Usage

This project compares two user-uploaded datasets to explore the relationship between alcohol addiction rates (ages 18–25) and daily mobile app usage time.
Using Pearson correlation, histogram plots, and a scatter plot, the script visualizes and quantifies the potential association between the variables.
