# Correlation Analysis: Addiction Rates vs Mobile App Usage

This project compares two user-uploaded datasets to explore the relationship between alcohol addiction rates (ages 18–25) and daily mobile app usage time.
Using Pearson correlation, histogram plots, and a scatter plot, the script visualizes and quantifies the potential association between the variables.

# 📌 Features

Reads two real-world datasets (drugs.csv and user_behavior_dataset.csv)

Cleans and aligns numerical values for analysis

Computes Pearson correlation coefficient and p-value

Plots:

Histogram of addiction rates

Histogram of mobile usage

Scatter plot comparing the two variables

Handles mismatched dataset lengths automatically
